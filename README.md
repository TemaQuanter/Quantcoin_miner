# Quantcoin miner
This is an original software for mining coins in the blockchain of [Quantcoin](http://tehnoquant.com/quantcoin/).

## Installation

First of all go to the project folder and open ```miner_address.txt``` file and put there the **public key** of your personal [Quantcoin wallet](https://github.com/TemaQuanter/Quantcoin_wallet) account. It will be used by the miner software to mine coins on it.

Quantcoin miner software requires [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.8+ to run.

After the installation of python 3, go to the project folder, open cmd on Windows, terminal on Mac os and Linux.

Run the following command:

#### On Windows

```sh
python miner_wallet.py
```

#### On Mac os and Linux

```sh
python3 miner_wallet.py
```

If you run the miner software for the first time, it might take a lot of time to download all the blocks from the Quantcoin blockchain.

Then you will see all the necessary information in cmd on Windows or terminal on Max os and Linux respectively. If you see that miner software needs your attention (you may see it in the console), please follow the instructions until everything needed will be done.

All in all, mining process is automatic and you can be free to run it on powerful servers as this software is cross-platform and do not have any UI, but terminal or cmd depending on the OS.

##### WARNING:
You should be aware that mining process may consume a lot of energy and may require great computational power of you PC or server.
